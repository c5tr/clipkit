# clipkit

this is a webapp to upload and host video files, with a focus on Discord embedding. It's still a work in progress.

## roadmap

- edit clips (edit button is not working)
- dialogs (edit/delete confirmation)
- user management
- custom/edit thumbnails

## stack

- [Remix](https://remix.run) (V2 compatible)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

## why?

i wanted to send video files above 25MB on Discord without Nitro, so i thought of creating this.
